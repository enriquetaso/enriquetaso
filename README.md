### Hi there 👋

I am Sofia, a software engineer based in Ireland! 🇦🇷 🇮🇪

🐍  I'm a Python enthusiast with over 6 years of experience. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at Red Hat. I'm a core @ [OpenStack/Cinder](https://github.com/openstack/cinder/), an open-source project that facilitates Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
 
🌱  Developed ✨["Millennials in Finance"](https://github.com/enriquetaso/sofi-super-blog/tree/main/finance)✨ a budget tracking RestAPI using the Django Rest Framework, and a [Telegram Bot](http://t.me/MillennialsInFinanceBot) 🤖 to interact with it and to keep track of my spending.

💻 I'm also a lazy [blogger](https://www.enriquetaso.com/blog/) and started my tech journey as an [intern](https://www.opnfv.org/blog/2019/01/16/opnfv-intern-spotlight-sofia-enriquez) at the Linux Foundation. In my free time I enjoy attending tech events✨, drinking coffee☕ and I'm passionate about mentoring aspiring software engineers through Outreachy internship programs and participated in the Grace Hopper Celebration | AnitaB.org as a mentor for their Open Source Day.
