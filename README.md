### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, I'm Sofia - an Argentinian who's loving life in Ireland! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª

ðŸ”­ I'm a Python pro with over 5 years of experience under my belt, currently working as a software engineer at Red Hat on the block storage team. I'm a core member of the open source project [OpenStack/Cinder](https://github.com/openstack/cinder/), which helps create Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

ðŸ”­ When I'm not crushing it in the redhatter coding world, I like to keep myself busy maintaining a few Django apps, including one called âœ¨ "Millennials in Finance"âœ¨ (because hey, even us techies need to know how to manage our money). I even created an easy-peasy [Finance Telegram Bot](http://t.me/MillennialsInFinanceBot) to make things more fun!

ðŸŒ± I'm also a lazy [blogger](https://www.enriquetaso.com/blog/) and started my tech journey as an [intern](https://www.opnfv.org/blog/2019/01/16/opnfv-intern-spotlight-sofia-enriquez) at the Linux Foundation. That experience was such a blast, I even went on to mentor twice for their Outreachy internship program. And if that wasn't enough, I recently joined the Grace Hopper Celebration as a mentor for their Open Source BootCamp - so you could say I'm a mentor extraordinaire. ðŸ˜‰
